# Air Quality Forecast: Machine Learning Model
Air quality has a significant impact on human health and the environment. The main factors affecting air quality in India are:

PM2.5 and PM10: Particulate matter

NO, NO2, NOx: Nitrogen oxides

NH3: Ammonia

CO: Carbon monoxide

SO2: Sulfur dioxide

O3: Ozone

Benzene, Toluene, Xylene: Volatile organic compounds

The primary goal of our air quality prediction model is to accurately forecast the Air Quality Index (AQI). AQI is an indicator that shows the level of air pollution and its effects on public health.
