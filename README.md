# Air Quality Forecast: Machine Learning Model
Air quality has a significant impact on human health and the environment. The main factors affecting air quality in India are:

PM2.5 and PM10: Particulate matter

NO, NO2, NOx: Nitrogen oxides

NH3: Ammonia

CO: Carbon monoxide

SO2: Sulfur dioxide

O3: Ozone

Benzene, Toluene, Xylene: Volatile organic compounds

The primary goal of our air quality prediction model is to accurately forecast the Air Quality Index (AQI). AQI is an indicator that shows the level of air pollution and its effects on public health.


Our model predicts future AQI values based on the levels of various pollutants that affect air quality. These predictions assist decision-makers in issuing health alerts, formulating environmental policies, optimizing traffic and industrial management, and helping the general public plan their daily activities.


### What is the business problem you are trying to solve using machine learning?

The problem you are trying to solve in this project is to predict future Air Quality Index (AQI) values by analyzing the factors affecting AQI using machine learning algorithms. These predictions can be used to monitor air quality and develop improvement strategies. The goal is to identify the impact of various pollutant parameters (PM2.5, PM10, NO, NO2, NOx, NH3, CO, SO2, O3, Benzene, Toluene, Xylene) on AQI and to forecast AQI based on the future values of these parameters.

### Why are we interested in solving this problem? What impact will it have on the business?

Solving this problem is of great importance for public health, environmental sustainability, and the protection of biodiversity. Accurately predicting air quality allows authorities and the public to take measures against air pollution. For example, health alerts and precautions can be issued. Regulations and policies related to air pollution can be developed. Industrial and traffic management can be optimized. By providing a cleaner environment to society, the quality of life can be improved.

### What are some known issues with the data? (data entry errors, missing data, unit differences, etc.)

Missing Data: Several columns, including the target column, have missing values.
Unit Differences: The Date column initially had a data type of object and has been converted to Datetime.
Seasonal Variations: Seasonal effects can introduce variability in the data.
